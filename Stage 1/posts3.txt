Hello all,

As you're all no doubt aware, vaccines have now been rolling out for several months, and we wanted to take some time to answer some commonly asked questions about what we've learned about the COVID-19 vaccines and to go over some of the recommendations about who should get vaccinated, what to expect, and usage of medications around vaccination.

If you have any questions, we're happy to answer them in the comments!

Special thanks to /u/YourWebcam for their help in research for this post!

# What do we know about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines?

As of early December, we had trial data showing that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were both highly effective when administered in a two-dose regimen, reaching efficacies of roughly 94-95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. We also had trial data (albeit with many caveats) suggesting that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine had an efficacy of roughly 62% in preventing COVID-19 with two full doses and a standard 4 week dosing schedule; some small subgroup analyses suggested potentially higher efficacies with different doses, though this was complicated due to differences in sample size, population, and dosing time.

Since then, we have continued to learn about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines, both from clinical trials and from the broader rollout of the vaccines to the general public.

## Oxford/AstraZeneca

As of early December, clinical trial data suggested that the Oxford/AstraZeneca had an efficacy of roughly 62% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with the standard dosages and a four week gap between doses. Most recently, in the United States, a [Phase 3 trial](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html) found that the vaccine was 76% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacious in preventing hospitalization and death with no significant safety concerns; it is expected that the vaccine will be submitted for Emergency Use Authorization in early April.

### Efficacy of One Dose

In their initial rollout, some nations chose to pursue a strategy of broadly administering the first dose to a greater number of people and planning to administer the second dose within 12 weeks rather than at four weeks.

To assess this strategy, researchers ran a clinical trial to answer two questions. First, the researchers wanted to determine whether administering a second dose after 12 weeks would result in robust protection against COVID-19. Second, the researchers wanted to determine whether one dose of the vaccine would offer adequate protection for at least 12 weeks.

The data from this trial, which was published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00432-3/fulltext), had positive findings on both of these questions. On the first point, the study found that after a 12 week administration schedule, the vaccine had an efficacy roughly 81%, compared to an efficacy of 55% when the second dose was administered within 6 weeks (though the confidence intervals overlapped between the two estimates). As such, the data suggested that at the very least, there was no significant difference between administering the vaccine within 6 weeks as opposed to delaying the vaccine for 12 weeks -- and potentially suggested a *higher* efficacy in the latter case. On the question of protection from a single dose, the authors found that the vaccine had an efficacy of 76% between the first dose and the second dose, suggesting that the first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine offers enough protection to warrant delaying the second dose to 12 weeks if needed. Finally, in both these trials, the vaccine had 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

These effect sizes were borne out in practice as well. In [an analysis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1) of the effectiveness of the vaccine as it was rolled out in England through mid-February, it was found that this vaccine had a 60-73% efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease in individuals over the age of 70 after one dose, with that single dose of the vaccine estimated to be 80% effective at preventing hospitalization.

### Efficacy Against Variants

Some studies, though limited in number and scope, have perfunctorily assessed efficacy of this vaccine against different variants of the virus. In the lab, [one study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.435000v1) focusing on hamsters found that the vaccine was effective against both the B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) lineages of COVID-19. Studies of the efficacy of the vaccine in practice are more limited. One [study](Efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7)) out of the UK found that this vaccine had similar efficacy between B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 lineages of COVID-19, suggesting that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be efficacious against B.1.1.7. However, [other studies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214?query=featured_home) focusing on the B.1.351 variant did not show efficacy of the vaccine in preventing mild-to-moderate COVID-19, though it is important to note that this study was small and likely very underpowered to detect any differences. Nonetheless, this suggests that this vaccine might potentially be less effective against the B.1.351 variant, though more research is needed on this point.

### Safety and Concerns about Clotting

In March 2021, some [concerns](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/03/30/blood-clots-and-the-az-vaccine-revisited) were raised about the safety of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after some reports of clotting abnormalities across Europe. In response, though the European Medical Agency urged otherwise, many European nations elected to temporarily suspend vaccination with this vaccine for several days.

Many of the reported cases consisted of deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms, which were occurring at roughly the rate expected for the general population. And indeed, in the United Kingdom, there has been no evidence of increased clotting abnormalities or thrombosis in the vaccinated population. However, in roughly 30 individuals across Europe, there have been reports of other conditions, including cerebral venous thromboses and thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and bleeding. It is still not known that these case reports are significantly above those expected in the general population as a whole; it is important to bear in mind that millions of individuals have received this vaccine to date, and the anticipated incidence is roughly in the single digits per *million* individuals vaccinated. However, [some early research](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/rare-clotting-disorder-may-cloud-worlds-hopes-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine) suggests that these cases bear some characteristics of vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), a condition in which the vaccine stimulates an immune response that causes platelets to form clots and become depleted. This condition is treatable with anticoagulants and immunoglobulin therapy, and it appears to occur primarily in younger populations -- though again, it is important to note that the incidence is on the order of a few cases per *million* vaccinated individuals.

Given the *extremely* low risk of this condition and the significantly greater benefit that the vaccine provides in preventing COVID-19, the European Medical Agency has stated that the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweigh its risks, even in younger individuals. Younger individuals, though less susceptible to COVID-19 than the elderly, still bear some risk from COVID-19, and that risk is *considerably* higher than the risk presented by these very infrequent clotting abnormalities. As such, the European Medical Agency has urged continued vaccination using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

## Pfizer/BioNTech

In late 2020, clinical trial data showed that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was roughly 95% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in individuals aged 16 or older, with more recent [continued data](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx) from their trial showing that the vaccine remained effective even at six months after vaccination. More recently, the company has [announced](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) that its trial of individuals aged 12-15 had similarly high efficacy and safety. On the basis of this data, this vaccine was widely authorized for use worldwide and has since been distributed to tens, if not *hundreds*, of millions of people. This has allowed for study of the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing COVID-19 in practice.

### Efficacy in Practice

Much of the data on the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in practice has come from Israel, where the vaccine has been rolled out broadly to a large proportion of its population. Here, we have found that the vaccine has been highly effective across the board. Two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, it was [reported](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/20022021-01) that the vaccine is roughly 98% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with roughly 99% or greater efficacy at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, or death from COVID-19. [More recent reports](https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Real-World-Evidence-Confirms-High-Effectiveness-of-Pfizer-BioNTech-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Profound-Public-Health-Impact-of-Vaccination-One-Year-After-Pandemic-Declared/default.aspx) have had similar findings, suggesting 97% efficacy or greater at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. Notably, these latter reports also found a 94% decrease in asymptomatic COVID-19 infections.

The [SIREN study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399) measured the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a set of healthcare workers in the United Kingdom, who were regularly tested for COVID-19 to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. They found, in total, that the vaccine was roughly 86% effective in preventing a COVID-19 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) one week after the second dose, which was not statistically significantly different from the Israeli findings.

### Efficacy of One Dose

The SIREN study also found that the vaccine was 76% efficacious 21 days after the first dose. This estimate is higher than that provided by a [similar study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790399) in Israel, which found that one dose was 57% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 from 14-20 days after the first dose, although the results are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that while two doses are needed for maximum protection, even one dose provides some amount of protection against COVID-19.

### Efficacy in Preventing Transmission

We do not have absolute, definitive data on the effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on transmission dynamics at this time. Nonetheless, we do have some amount of data that suggests the vaccine will reduce spread of the virus. First, as mentioned above, several studies have now found that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reduces infections rather than just symptoms; in particular, the vaccine is able to prevent a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. In addition, recent data out of Israel, published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01316-7), found that one dose of the vaccine was able to drastically reduce the viral load for those infections that did occur. Together, these results all suggest that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can drastically reduce the risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, potentially/likely reducing transmission after the same as well.

### Efficacy Against Variants

Some limited amount of data has emerged about the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against different variants of COVID-19. This data has, at times, been somewhat muddled and contradictory, in no small part because the lab studies on the topic have often used different methods to make their assessments, not all of which are as useful as others. However, in general, some broad statements can be made. First, as a recent [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01318-5) study noted, it is likely that the neutralizing titers of serum from vaccinated individuals will be lower against the B.1.1.7, P.1, and especially the B.1.351 variants of the virus (UK, Brazil, and South African variants, respectively).

However, it is important to maintain context on what lower titers actually mean; all it means is that there is *less* of the neutralizing antibody in the blood. That does not mean that there is not *enough* neutralizing antibody to still successfully suppress the virus. The gold standard for determining whether the neutralizing antibodies are able to stop the virus from infecting cells is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which measures whether the serum is able to prevent cell death after exposure to the virus. In a recent [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017) to this effect, it was found that serum from individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was able to robustly neutralize all of the tested variants of the virus, including the B1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 variants of the virus.

Finally, it is important to remember that antibody neutralization is *not* the same thing as vaccine immunity; there are many components of the immune response beyond antibody neutralization, and a poor antibody response does not preclude immunity against COVID-19.

Outside of lab data, the B.1.1.7 strain remain most prevalent in the United Kingdom and Israel, where many of the above efficacy studies appear to show high efficacy. In addition, though underpowered, the South African arm of the Pfizer trial showed 100% efficacy of the vaccine against severe infection which, in the context of the lab studies, strongly suggests the vaccine maintains significant efficacy against the B.1.351 variant.

## Moderna

In late 2020, clinical trial data (later published in the [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389)) showed that the Moderna vaccine was roughly 94% efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death. On the basis of this data, the Moderna vaccine was authorized in many jurisdictions and has since been distributed to large numbers of individuals. Due to the more limited supply of the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech worldwide, the Moderna vaccine has not had as many large, nationwide studies specifically aimed at determining efficacy of the vaccine for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, though it is highly likely that given their highly similar mechanisms of action, properties found of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely hold for the Moderna vaccine. However, these studies are ongoing, as are clinical trials to test the vaccine in pediatric populations and to identify boosters against variants.

## Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen

In January 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen (hereafter abbreviated as J&amp;J) announced that their Phase 3 trial found that their one-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19, with 85% efficacy against preventing clinically severe COVID-19 and no deaths in the vaccinated group due to COVID-19. On the basis of these data, the vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization in many jurisdictions around the world and has since been rolled out to millions of people.

This is, as noted above, a one-dose vaccine regimen at present. Studies on the efficacy of a two-dose regimen are currently ongoing, as are studies on the ability of the vaccine to prevent transmission of COVID-19.

### Efficacy Against Variants

The [J&amp;J trial](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) was run around the world, allowing for assessment of the efficacy of the vaccine against different variants prevalent at different regions. Overall, the vaccine had an efficacy of 66%, but this varied across regions. In the United States, the J&amp;J vaccine had an efficacy of roughly 72%, whereas in South Africa (where the B.1.351 variant is predominant), the vaccine had an efficacy of 64% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. The vaccine had roughly 68% efficacy against moderate to severe disease in Brazil, where the P.1 and P.2 variants are prevalent. Nonetheless, across the world, the vaccine remained highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. Trials are ongoing to determine if specific boosters against variants will improve efficacy of the vaccine.

## Novavax

In March 2021, Novavax [reported](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0#:~:text=NVX%2DCoV2373%20is%20being%20evaluated,that%20began%20in%20December%202020%20.) that their Phase 3 trial had reached its final analysis, showing that their vaccine was roughly 96% efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. However, this vaccine appeared significantly affected by the South African variant of COVID-19; in the South African arm of the trial, it was found to have an efficacy of roughly 55% in HIV-negative individuals. Nonetheless, the vaccine was highly effective in preventing severe disease, even in South Africa. Continued studies are ongoing to determine the efficacy of the vaccine against different variants. This vaccine candidate is currently not yet authorized in most jurisdictions.

# Who should get a COVID-19 vaccine?

The following sections will go through the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html) and recommendations for vaccination. Depending on your jurisdiction, other regulatory agencies may have slightly different recommendations. This is not to be construed as medical advice; it is strictly a discussion of the CDC guidelines. If you have questions about your medical conditions and whether it poses a contraindication to vaccination, please speak with your physician.

It is currently recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be given to all people above the age of 16 that do not have medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated. Some regulators have subdivided different vaccines as being used for different populations; for example, the AstraZeneca vaccine, in some jurisdiction, is preferentially used for elderly populations, whereas the Pfizer vaccine is the only vaccine used for individuals between 16 and 18 years of age. However, in general, unless there is a medical contraindication to vaccination, all individuals are medically eligible to be vaccinated!

## Contraindications and Precautions to Vaccination

Per the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html), the only absolute contraindications to vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine are a known and documented history of severe and/or immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or a component of the vaccine. In addition, individuals with a history of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection are considered to have a precaution to vaccination. Both these groups of individuals should consult with an allergist-immunologist to discuss vaccination strategies prior to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

The COVID-19 vaccines do not have latex, eggs, or gelatin. As such, the CDC does not consider allergies to these substances to be contraindications or precautions to COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, the CDC does not consider allergies to other oral drugs or environmental factors to be contraindications or precautions to vaccination.

Because individuals in the clinical trials received no other vaccinations within 14 days of COVID-19 vaccination (including the influenza vaccine), there is only limited data on coadministration with other vaccines. As such, it is currently recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine not be administered within 2 weeks of another vaccine.

## Recommendations for Individuals with Past COVID-19 or Exposure to COVID-19

The clinical trials showed that individuals with past COVID-19 infection still received the vaccine safely and efficaciously. As such, past COVID-19 is not a medical contraindication or precaution to vaccination. However, while vaccine supplies are still limited, it is recommended that individuals that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the previous 90 days defer their vaccination until at least 90 days have passed due to the low risk of reinfection during that timeframe.

Individuals that have had a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 should not go into the community to get a vaccine until their quarantine has ended to prevent transmission of the virus. However, if the patient is in a congregate setting where healthcare services can be provided without exposing the community or healthcare workers, the patient can receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

## Individuals with Chronic Conditions

The clinical trials included individuals with a wide range of common chronic conditions; conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity, asthma, COPD, etc., are not contraindications to vaccination for COVID-19 -- and indeed, individuals with these conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and should be vaccinated.

HIV and other immunocompromising conditions are not contraindications to vaccination because the COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines, meaning that they should not pose a particular safety risk to immunocompromised individuals. The clinical trials included individuals with HIV and found that the vaccine was still efficacious, though often somewhat less than for individuals without HIV, and was still safe. Immunocompromised individuals should speak with their treating physician to discuss the optimal timing of receiving the vaccines, particularly if they are on immunomodulatory medication.

There is currently no evidence suggesting that autoimmune conditions, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), or Bell's palsy are associated with the COVID-19 vaccines. As such, the CDC states that a history of these conditions is not a contraindication to vaccination; individuals with autoimmune conditions, GBS, or Bell's palsy can receive the COVID-19 vaccines unless they have a separate contraindication.

Finally, there were some reports that individuals with a history of injectable dermal filler usage experienced rare instances of swelling near the filler site after receiving an mRNA vaccine (i.e. Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna). These cases are relatively rare and are easily treated without serious complications. As such, the CDC recommends that a history of dermal filler injection is not a contraindication to vaccination, but if swelling is observed at filler sites after the vaccine, that the patient should contact their physician.

## Pregnant and Lactating Individuals

There is no evidence or reason to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines pose a safety risk to the mother or the child when administered to pregnant or lactating individuals, particularly after the vaccination of hundreds of millions of individuals around the world. In addition, pregnant women are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, with an increased risk of poor outcomes to both the mother and the child.

As such, though the clinical trials did not explicitly test the vaccine in pregnant women, based on the safety data and vaccination experience to date, the CDC recommends that pregnant women be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a view shared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.

Similarly, there is no reason to believe that the vaccine will pose a risk in lactating women, so they are also eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

# What side effects should I expect after vaccination, and when should I seek medical care?

Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine can include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. In addition, you may experience fatigue, muscle and joint pains, fever, chills, nausea, headaches, sweating, swollen lymph nodes, or other flu-like symptoms. These are a sign that the body is generating an immune response and is developing protective immunity.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) recommends that you call a doctor if:

* Your arm pain, redness, or swelling continues to worsen more than 24 hours after you received the vaccine, or
* Your symptoms do not resolve within a few days, or
* If you are worried about your symptoms for any other reason.

Severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, such as anaphylaxis, are very rare, especially more than 15 minutes after the vaccine. However, if you believe you are having a severe allergic reaction or other sever reaction, it is recommended that you should seek emergency medical care. Symptoms of anaphylaxis [include](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html):

* Throat tightening, difficulty breathing
* Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* Dizziness, fainting, palpitations, flushing, pallor
* Hives, redness, itchiness, immediate and marked swelling
* Agitation, confusion

This condition is quite rare and is easily treatable with prompt medical attention. Virtually all cases of anaphylaxis will present immediately, within 15 minutes of vaccination. However, being mindful of these symptoms is nonetheless wise.

# What are the current guidelines on NSAID use before and after vaccination?

Per [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/prepare-for-vaccination.html), it is not recommended that you stop taking any medications that you are currently on without first consulting with your physician. If you are taking NSAIDs daily for management of a chronic medical condition, you should not stop taking them before the COVID-19 vaccine without asking your physician.

The CDC recommends not taking additional medications beyond your daily medication regimen, including NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Tylenol), before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC does not have specific data or recommendations on whether NSAIDs or acetaminophen will reduce efficacy of the vaccine. However, the participants in the clinical trials for the vaccines were not told to avoid NSAIDs or acetaminophen after the vaccine, and there is not evidence suggesting that the vaccine was less efficacious in individuals that did take these medications. As such, unless you have a specific medical condition that prevents you from taking these drugs, most institutions recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen for relief of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

# What are the current guidelines on alcohol or marijuana use before and after vaccination?

The participants in the clinical trials were not instructed to avoid alcohol or marijuana after the vaccine, and there is not specific data that would suggest it impacts vaccine efficacy. However, it is important to keep in mind that both alcohol and marijuana carry health risks of their own, and using these drugs or others can exacerbate side effects from the vaccine, which can unnecessarily delay recovery.

# Is there a relationship between vaccine side effects and protection from COVID-19?

Individuals in the clinical trials that reported few-to-no side effects were still protected with more than 90% efficacy, as were individuals that reported significant side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines. As such, there is no reason to believe that there is any significant relationship between the vaccine side effects and the protection conferred by the vaccine.

# Would emergence of a vaccine-resistant variant require full clinical trials for an updated vaccine?

Though not all regulatory bodies or jurisdictions have made firm indications, the US FDA has [indicated](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) that minor updates to approved vaccines to cover future variants of SARS-CoV-2 would not need to undergo a separate three-phase trial; rather, an expedited immunogenicity trial can be conducted to verify that the vaccine produces an immune response against the variant of the virus, and the vaccine could be quickly authorized and distributed as an amendment to the previous authorization or approval.

Ive been studying viruses in the laboratory since 1975 when I obtained my PhD with Peter Palese, studying influenza viruses. I then went on to do postdoctoral research with Nobel laureate David Baltimore at MIT. There I produced the first infectious DNA copy of an animal virus, poliovirus. In 1982 I started my laboratory at Columbia which has been active to this day. Some of our accomplishments include identification of the cell receptor for poliovirus, and establishment of the first transgenic mouse model for a viral disease, poliomyelitis.

I not only do research on viruses but have written a virology textbook, I teach virology to undergraduates at Columbia, do a weekly podcast about viruses (microbe.tv/twiv), and much more (YouTube.com/profvrr). All of this makes me uniquely qualified to talk about a viral pandemic.

In this AMA Ill be pleased to answer questions on SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, including origins of the virus, virus variants and their properties, the disease, vaccination, antivirals, and what the future holds for us.

I will be here between 1pm-3pm eastern time US to answer your questions.

Great news /r/Coronavirus users!

This week we have two spectacular AMA guests lined up:

**Wednesday, April 7th, at 11am EST** - [Dr. Tom Frieden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Frieden) is an infectious disease and public health expert who served as the Director of the CDC for the Obama Administration, and is the former Health Commissioner of New York City ('02-'09).

**Thursday, April 8th, 1pm EST** - [Dr. Vincent Racaneillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Racaniello) is a Higgins Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is also co-author of a textbook on virology, "Principles of Virology", as well as the host of the well known virology podcast [This Week in Virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_in_Virology)

As we have always done, these AMA's will be posted 1hr *before* they go live, so that we can have questions ready for the guest to just come in and hit the ground running!

We hope these two AMA's can answer the many nagging questions I'm sure a lot of you have about vaccines, vaccine side effects, variants, spread, and just about anything that has to do with SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID19!

Hey all,

Recently, our team voted to temporarily go private in order to join many other communities in protest of Reddits hiring practices. Just a few hours later, [the Reddit CEO's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/) was posted and we immediately made the subreddit public once more. 

If any breaking news had been released in relation to public health during the time we were private (e.g., a release from the WHO, CDC or such), we would have absolutely opened the sub up for that. We were monitoring for this throughout. We made the [vaccine finder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq/vaccinefinder), the only real time sensitive thing we have on the sub, available in the message users saw when we made it private.

We, like many other moderator teams, discuss and vote on major decisions so that differences in opinions can be heard and disagreements that do occur can be resolved in an amicable fashion. However, in this particular instance, the top moderator at the time opposed our decision and, within days, removed several moderators, restricted the permissions of the rest, and began inviting a new moderation team unrelated to the subreddit.


Yesterday, after detailed discussions, the now-former top moderator resigned and the original team was restored. We are now actively working to restore any changes that were made and return to providing high quality information on the COVID-19 pandemic. We would also like to take this time to refute all of the rumors that began to spread regarding the personal character of the former top moderator. These rumors and personal attacks are categorically false, and we do appreciate him working with us to restore the original mod team and put r/Coronavirus back on track.

Many of us have been here for more than a little while, and we've all put in countless hours into making the subreddit tick.  We haven't been perfect, but we've tried our hardest to make sure the r/Coronavirus community is one we could be proud of, and we hope that you can be proud of it too. We are glad that the former top moderator has done the right thing and we are looking forward to getting back to work.

If you have any questions, ask away.

 One year ago today, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. Its been 12 months of change and daily news, so we are taking today to reflect on what this means to us.

This thread is to reminisce on what you were thinking and feeling at that time. We also welcome you to discuss what we've learned in the past year - whether scientific, about society, or yourself.

**Please keep discussion civil and respectful to one another.**

Hi all,

The mod team is looking into compiling an organized list of vaccine-finding resources to help people locate vaccination locations, available appointments, and scheduling information to receive the COVID-19 vaccine! We're looking for any suggestions that anyone may have that can help with any of these goals!

It doesn't have to be big or nationwide -- we'll do our best to compile statewide or citywide resources as well. Nor does this list have to be dedicated solely to the United States -- vaccine locators around the world are welcome.

Thank you for your help!

-the mod team

Will Humble is the Executive Director for the Arizona Public Health Association. He has been very outspoken about the states[response](https://coppercourier.com/story/ducey-leads-arizona-into-global-covid-hotspot-for-second-time/)to the COVID-19 pandemic and has repeatedly asked state leaders to implement[public health measures](https://coppercourier.com/story/coronavirus-spread-arizona-ducey-business-open/)that would[slow the spread](https://coppercourier.com/story/mask-ordinance-proven-reduce-coronavirus-arizona/)of the virus.

His 30 years in public health included more than 2 decades at the Arizona Department of Health Services, where he served in various capacities including as the Agency Director from 2009 to 2015.

Most recently, he served as a health policy director at the University of Arizona from 2015 to 2017. He continues to be involved in health policy in his role with AzPHA and as Adjunct Faculty with The University of Arizona's Mel &amp; Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health.

As a part of a Reddit AMA series called Everything You Need To Know About The COVID-19 Vaccine, I've been asked to do this AMA. I wrote [*Anti-Vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/anti-vaxxers), before SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, but I've kept up with the growth of anti-vaccine sentiment and vaccine hesitancy around the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. [Evidence of my identity.](https://twitter.com/jonathanberman/status/1355244275273969664?s=20) Ask me anything.

EDIT: Link formatting

EDIT the second: Going to take a break at 2pm EST to get some work done in the lab, and get some lunch. I'll try to come back later this afternoon and see if there are any additional questions.

This year has been a crazy year - Kobe Bryant, Alex Trebek, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, Australia was on fire, and of course, the world got hit with a coronavirus pandemic. 

2020 wasn't a great year for most people...

However, 2021 is a NEW YEAR, and we want to know what you, the users, are most looking forward to in 2021. Vaccines, seeing friends, going to movies/concerts, or just sitting down at a restaurant to eat - let us know what gives you hope for 2021!

I am David Quammen, a journalist and author of several books, including "SPILLOVER: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic."

In 2013, soon after "SPILLOVER" appeared, I wrote an article for The New York Times Opinion section about the next pandemic, "The Next Big One." I suggested that something from the coronavirus family, which resides endemically in bats, was a model for the kind of virus that might cause such a global disease crisis in the future. This year, I have written several articles about the coronavirus pandemic, its origins and how we have responded or failed to respond. Ask Me Anything.

Hello all!

In light of the vaccine approvals that have already come and will likely continue to develop over the coming days and weeks, we wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the background for how we've been able to safely and effectively develop a vaccine so rapidly.

From our new [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/edit/faq):

Several factors enabled rapid development and testing of vaccines without compromising safety or efficacy.

First, previous research has enabled us to reduce the time necessary to begin developing and testing a vaccine candidate. Advances in vaccine technology have allowed researchers to develop vaccines based only on the genomic sequence of the virus in question ([released on Jan 10th](https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319)). As such, vaccine scientists were able to begin development of vaccine candidates in mid-January, even though the virus was still difficult to obtain at that time.That said, due to global spread of the virus in the following months, laboratories around the world have independently isolated and generated stocks of virus that then could be used to test vaccine efficacy.

In addition, we have considerable existing research on other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that we were able to use to gain rapid insight into SARS-CoV-2. Ordinarily, pharmaceutical companies would wait for more basic research into the novel virus to develop a vaccine with best chances at high efficacy, in no small part due to the high cost of running clinical trials and bringing a vaccine to market. In this case, however, governments around the world were willing to underwrite significant portions of the costs of clinical trials, reducing the financial risk  for pharmaceutical companies to develop and produce a vaccine without preliminary data,but heavily leveraging existing research into coronaviruses. These two factors likely reduced the timeline required for vaccine development by months to years. 

Second, administrative delays in the vaccine-development timeline were mitigated or outright eliminated during the development of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates. One of the most important such delay is the processing of data and applications between phases of trials or after a trial is complete. For example, just for the formal new drug application stage alone, the [United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-20-301) has a target of 8 months to process and review priority applications, with a target of 12 months for regular applications; delays beyond this timeframe are not uncommon, and the new drug application is only one of several intermediate applications that are needed to progress through different phases of clinical trials. By contrast, the applications to progress through clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine candidates are being processed and analyzed in a more timely manner by regulatory agencies -- again, shaving unnecessary months to years off the approval timeline.

Third, the nature of the pandemic makes the clinical trials easier to conduct. One of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks for a vaccine or drug candidate is to show superiority over existing drugs or vaccines that are on the market already; however, there were no existing vaccines against COVID-19, so the vaccines simply needed to be tested for superiority over a placebo. In addition, clinical trials often have difficulty enrolling subjects; it normally takes months to years to fully enroll a clinical trial. However, with the number of individuals that wanted to join each of the vaccine trials, enrollment was completed with unprecedented speed. Finally, trials for vaccine candidates often take a long time to complete even after enrollment because many of the pathogens they seek to prevent are relatively rare or regional; as a result, it takes considerably longer for enough infection events to occur, and accordingly longer to be able to determine whether the vaccine is effective. However, in the midst of a global pandemic, infection events are in no short supply, and by sheer numbers, people are infected rapidly in the trials and statistical significance can be reached much more quickly. Again, collectively, these factors reduce the needed timeline by months to years without sacrificing rigor. 

Despite this speed, we are still able to effectively judge whether these vaccine candidates will be safe. We have considerable knowledge of the fundamental biology underlying many of these vaccine candidates that allow us to better judge their safety, and after confirmation of their safety, human studies using RNA as therapeutic, both for [vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243), and in other ways to treat diseases are underway since years. Although  mRNA vaccine are yet to be approved by the FDA for use in humans (in large part due to low cost-benefit to companies), the molecular biology of mRNA has been studied extensively for decades, and knowledge of the biological pathways involved with mRNA processing and degradation allows us to state with a high degree of confidence that the active component of the vaccine will be degraded quickly and poses no increased risk of causing genetic aberration. (Of note: an infection with the real virus or withany other common cold RNA virus, will generate vastly more viral mRNA in the body's cells than the vaccine carries.) This was borne out in the [animal studies](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9792931264) of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which found their vaccines did not cause toxicity in animals and conferred immunity against the virus. In addition, the most prominent vaccine candidates (mRNA and adenovirus vectors) do not contain the whole genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or even an attenuated/inactivated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, meaning that they present no risk of actually causing COVID-19.

The trials are also sufficiently long (even with all this streamlining) to be able to catch adverse events that would occur with any significant frequency. Indeed, the vast, overwhelming majority of adverse events after vaccination present within days to weeks of vaccination. For example, the very rare, but one of the most severe possible side-effects, Guillane-Barre syndrome (GBS) almost always arises within [6 weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985921/) of receiving the influenza vaccine; [other adverse reactions](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html) due to vaccines present similarly quickly or even sooner. This timeframe for adverse events to appear is markedly shorter than the time for evaluation of the vaccine candidates. The FDA, for example, mandated that the subjects in the trial had to be monitored for a median of [at least two months](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) before an emergency use authorization application would be considered. This enables regulatory agencies to adequately assess the safety profile of the vaccines. In clear contrast, the viral infection carries significant side-/chronic effects for a large number of people, and without vaccine immunity, at least 50-70% of individuals would be infected without indefinite public health measures. 

To summarize, the development of these vaccines has not been this rapid because we have cut corners or sacrificed rigor. Moreso, these trials have progressed at a rapid pace because of pre-existing research and technology that could be leveraged to develop a vaccine candidate quickly, policy decisions to mitigate usual administrative delays, and the impact that rapid spread of a novel pathogen has on the logistics of a clinical trial. Collectively, these factors have comfortably reduced the development timeline by years while still allowing for sufficient assessment of efficacy and safety.

Looked back and saw that my first social media post about a then nameless virus was on January 8th. I joked at the time that its all I would be talking about for the foreseeable future because I have a huge interest in zoonosis and emergent viruses.

Little did I know...

I quickly started waiting for the Chinese health ministry to release their daily reports at 9PM my time, then stayed up until about 12AM talking to users about what that data may mean.

Well. Its been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight.

Im sure I dont need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year its been.

What I can tell you is that as a virologist who is usually alone in annoying people with my weird virus memes, that weird niche of content experienced a huge boom in 2020.

Lets celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all: the memes.

Hi everyone,

The holidays this year will be different for a lot of us and with that in mind, we wanted to make a safe thread on the sub for anyone who is feeling alone or wants a place to talk with others!

This thread was inspired by Thanksgiving, but it is for everyone all over the world. We invite you to share all the things that make you happy, share your cutest pet pics or your favorite holiday recipes!

All trolling or bad faith comments will be removed - this is a place to come together as a community and help make the season a little brighter for everyone here.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Howdy!

In an attempt to rejuvenate the Daily Discussion thread, users have requested that a section for frequently asked questions be added. I've actually been wanting to do this for a while, so I'm excited to see there's an interest. What would y'all like answered?

Keep in mind that we, unfortunately, can't predict the future. I can tell you how an mRNA vaccine works, but I can't tell you how vaccine development will go.

Hello /r/Coronavirus,

As the United States presidential election approaches, we would like to remind you to read our subreddit rules and follow them while participating here. In particular, please keep in mind rules 1, 4, 5, and 8 when posting and commenting.

Please be civil and courteous to others when posting and commenting and do not celebrate, instigate, or threaten harm, even as a joke and even if you vehemently disagree with them. Please [remember the human](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/) in your interactions with people. [Rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1.3A_be_civil) on our wiki has more information.

Posts and comments also must be [not primarily political in nature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4.3A_avoid_politics) and must [primarily relate to the coronavirus outbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_8.3A_keep_submissions_on_topic). Even related subjects such as healthcare are not considered on topic unless they are primarily about the coronavirus outbreak. Elections predictions and results are also off topic and will be removed. This subreddit is not a place to campaign for a candidate.

In addition, be vigilant about the information that you read and [only submit high quality content from reputable sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5.3A_keep_information_quality_high). Fearmongering, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and other unreliable content is strictly not allowed on this subreddit. Please report it if you see it.

Thank you and have a good day.

With the rapid increase in severity of the coronavirus situation, we feel as though it is important to make a difference in any way we can. 

Therefore, we are calling on YOU, our users, to help scientists progress research!

**What does this mean?**

This post will host all of the studies/surveys for users to participate in. **Participation is strictly voluntary, and you may withdraw from any of the below studies at any time.** This post will be stickied to the r/Coronavirus subreddit whenever possible in order to give these projects ample exposure.

**For Researchers:** If you would like to have your study/survey posted, please [send us modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCoronavirus) and we will give you instructions on how to verify your study.

In addition, there is a useful resource available for researchers from SafeGraph. They are sharing their data and that of their partners free for non-commercial and academic research use. To access this database, please [click here](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium?utm_source=consortium_outreach&amp;utm_campaign=consortium_rd)

**For Users:** Feel free to click on the links to any of the studies posted here that interest you and for which you qualify. Again, you are under no obligation to participate in any of the studies listed.


**Disclaimer:** All of the studies posted here have been verified to be authentic studies, either from a recognized research facility, government organization, or academic institution, and are conducted with all the necessary ethical and legal considerations. Individual studies may outline their specific disclaimers in the comments.

**NOTE: This post will remain active at all times. Please check back intermittently as we will be adding new studies on a regular basis. We may unpin the post from our front page to promote featured projects or AMAs, but we will re-pin it after the special events have ended. Individual comments with study details will be removed when the study has ended.**

*Why did you guys make a new post? - Reddit automatically archives posts after 6 months, so we needed to make another post to keep it active in order to add studies*

Greetings Reddit! We are here on behalf of Babson Diagnostics, a medical technology company in Austin, TX, who is conducting a clinical study about COVID-19 antibody testing at PeoplesRx Wellness Center on Research Blvd. We are looking to recruit Austin-area adults who suspect they may have had COVID-19 and would like to know their current IgG antibody status. Here are the details:

 

* Participants must be 18 years of age or older and willing to have a small amount of blood taken from one inner elbow and two fingertips.
* A combination of commercially available and investigational antibody tests will be used. Participants will receive antibody test results from the commercially available test method, but not from the investigational test methods.
* It will take about 30 minutes to participate (one-time visit).
* Participants will receive a $60 PeoplesRx gift card.

 

Please email us at [studies@babsondx.com](mailto:studies@babsondx.com) for more information or to schedule a visit. You can read more about our antibody test at [https://babsondx.com/science/covid-19-testing](https://babsondx.com/science/covid-19-testing).

&amp;#x200B;

Stay healthy and stay safe!

Hey everyone! We're back with a second round of the Thursday Science Only sticky. We've heard many complaints, and we're hoping this weekly sticky will allow people to just discuss the pandemic.

This sticky is strictly for discussing the science of the pandemic. Have questions about the virus? Want to discuss your experience with being infected? Ask how different masks work? Vaccine development? Treatments? Academic papers? Feel free to discuss and debate any of these topics.

The sub rule on politics will be strictly enforced as well as no policy discussion either. For example on politics, any comments that mention Trump or Republicans or Democrats or criticisms of the US, China, UK, etc will be removed. Examples of policy discussion that isn't allowed: reopening schools, national mask mandates, federal relief bills, etc. This rule only pertains to this sticky.

Please feel free to discuss anything pertaining to coronavirus that falls outside of those two categories.

Hey everyone! We're trying out a new sticky this week, and if it's popular, we will bring it back. We've heard many complaints, and we're hoping this weekly sticky will allow people to just discuss the pandemic.

This sticky is strictly for discussion the science of the pandemic. Have questions about the virus? Want to discuss your experience with being infected? Ask how different masks work? Vaccine development? Treatments? Academic papers? Feel free to discuss and debate any of these topics.

The sub rule on politics will be strictly enforced as well as no policy discussion either. For example on politics, any comments that mention Trump or Republicans or Democrats or criticisms of the US, China, UK, etc will be removed. Examples of policy discussion that isn't allowed: reopening schools, national mask mandates, federal relief bills, etc. This rule only pertains to this sticky.

Please feel free to discuss anything pertaining to coronavirus that falls outside of those two categories.

Im NBC New York reporter Melissa Russo. Last month, I wrote a story about how doctors in New York were seeing a disturbing spike in kids who were testing negative for COVID-19 but exhibiting an odd combination of symptoms that looked like a cross between toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. Doctors suspected it was related to Covid-19 but neither the city nor the state health departments were talking about it.

As sources from various hospitals confirmed they were seeing the same thing, and local public health agencies had no public guidance to offer, we continued airing stories suggesting potentially dozens of children were sick. The city and state finally took action, which ultimately prompted the CDC to respond. (Both NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio later publicly acknowledged our role in bringing the situation to light.)

The condition now has a name  MIS-C  and we know that in just New York state, at least 179 kids are sick and three have died. Nationwide, there are hundreds of cases, forcing authorities to reconsider whether schools, camps and playgrounds really are safe for kids during the pandemic.

Im here today to answer your questions about MIS-C, the governments response and what happens next. Ask me anything!

Hi, my name is Garry Cooper and I am the CEO and Co-founder of the resource-sharing company, [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/). Rheaplys technology accelerates the circular economy by allowing organizations to share idle materials, thus promoting the reuse of assets. Our AxM platform enables companies to share and sell physical assets within and between organizations. AxM serves some of our nations most vital institutions: universities, biopharma and biotech companies, major technology companies, and government entities.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rheaply has [partnered](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200522005388/en) with the City of Chicago and World Business Chicago to connect Chicagos small businesses and nonprofits with personal protective equipment (PPE). In preparation for the reopening of the city, small organizations can use the platform to access hand sanitizer, protective shields, and face masks to protect their staff.

We also developed an adaptation of our core technology that connects healthcare providers and first responders with much-needed PPE and other critical medical supplies.

With these initiatives, we aim to address the supply shortages organizations and healthcare providers face by helping direct these supplies to the places where the need is most dire.

**Im here to answer questions about supply shortages, resource reallocation, and how our technology works.**

Helping our Healthcare Heroes - Tradelasts

Over the past month, in response to the Covid-19 crisis, Tradelasts has pivoted its business model of building a trusted community of vacation homeowners to a not-for-profit version to provide free vacations to the families of medical personnel on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Tradelasts has to date received over 700 nominations of frontline medical personnel to receive a free vacation.  They need your help to spread the word to those with vacation homes so as to serve these broken healthcare warriors.  Tradelasts also hopes their program will create a boost to the crippled travel industry by getting families back on vacation as soon as possible. Visit their website www.tradelasts.com to see how you, your friends and family can help by donating time in your second home, nominating a healthcare provider for a free vacation, or volunteering your time.

Proof it's me: https://i.imgur.com/dhZfG7s.jpg
 
The pandemic has disrupted our lives throughout the globe, and Istanbul has been no exception.
 
We as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality are responsible for providing and maintaining services in transportation, infrastructure, environment, utilities, arts, culture, social aid, sports, and a lot more to a city of 16 million people.
 
My team and I are now dealing with unprecedented challenges in each of our areas of operation, along with a few rare opportunities.
 
We have been working round the clock for the past few months to help limit the contagion of the disease and provide relief for those bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Simultaneously, we are taking advantage of the lockdown as an opportunity to cleanse and disinfect public spaces, repave major roads and squares, upgrade our drainage systems, continue the construction of our new metro lines, and enhance cooperation with our international partners and counterparts.
 
Just like everywhere, the pandemic has brought out the best of our people. In less than a week, our fellow citizens have raised over $2 million in solidarity via our bill-on-the-hook campaign to pay the water and gas bills of those Istanbulites financially struggling during the lockdown.
 
I will be here for the next hour to share our experience and answer your quest

Hello!

We are the [www.helpers.tools](http://www.helpers.tools/) team here to answer your questions about looking after your mental health during this huge change we are all experiencing together. We are qualified and practicing psychologists.

Something that mixes your whole life up suddenly can turn up the heat on all the problems we are used to juggling as part of a busy life. Even if you have never considered yourself someone who has mental health problems you might have some questions about how to handle whatever you are finding tricky right now.

[www.helpers.tools](http://www.helpers.tools/) is a free 6 week course of support delivered over email that we built as a volunteer effort. It is not a business or commercial project. Combining short and simple behavioural nudges with longer weekly sessions designed to be used by two or more people in conversation, the helpers tools are designed to be a blueprint enabling a community to provide crucial psychological support for itself - without needing to wait.

Answering your questions today will be volunteer members of our clinical team. We will be collaborating on our answers behind the scenes. Youll be speaking with: 

* Dr Jo Birkett
* Dr Fergus Kane 
* Whitney Ireland 
* Dr Hannah Pettman

You can see more about us and our qualifications [on our website](https://www.helpers.tools/team). 

**Were here to answer questions about your mental health and how it is interacting with COVID19. Were also happy to field any questions about how or why you might use helpers.** 

Disclaimer: While were doing this to provide support it is not intended to replace individual treatment with your local mental health services.

Researchers worldwide are racing at breakneck speed to develop potential vaccines and drugs to fight the novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2. Last month, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted a patent to Tel Aviv Universitys Prof. Jonathan Gershoni of the School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology at TAUs George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences for his innovative vaccine design for the corona family of viruses. (citation: https://english.m.tau.ac.il/news/covid19-Jonathan-Gershoni) [Link to EdX class on viruses](https://www.edx.org/course/viruses-how-to-beat-them-cells-immunity-vaccines)
 Link to some of my research: 
- [B-cell restriction  an alternative piece to the puzzle]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945969)
- [Reconstitution of the receptor-binding motif of the SARS coronavirus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487711)
- [Epitope Mapping - The First Step in Developing Epitope-Based Vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17516710)

- [Molecular decoys: antidotes, therapeutics and
immunomodulators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127390/)


Prof. Jonathan Gershoni completed his BSc in Biology and PhD in Biochemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  He then did Post-doctoral training with Prof. George E. Palade at Yale School of Medicine where he began his research on the interaction of rabies virus and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Over the last decades Prof. Gershoni has focused on developing new methods for the rational design of vaccines to such pandemic diseases as AIDS, Hepatitis C, influenza and SARS/MERS.  In particular, he has developed a suite of combinatorial phage display peptide libraries and used them to critically interrogate the humoral response towards virus infection.  Ask me anything!

Hi everyone. I work in The Economist's data team, creating data visualisations for our coronavirus coverage, among other things. I created our chart explaining how to "[flatten the curve](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1235955113811783682)", which went viral in early March. I can answer questions about how to visualise covid-19 and its effects, and anything else about [data journalism at The Economist](https://medium.economist.com/why-you-sometimes-need-to-break-the-rules-in-data-viz-4d8ece284919).

From u/rocket_nick 

We're a software company at our core.

We thought, what is the best way we could help people right now.

So we made [MaskHelpers](https://www.maskhelpers.org/) a free place that makers, distributors and people in need could get connected.

We're not asking for money, we're even working to connect people who have supplies or want to donate to makers.

Check it out, and let me know what you think!

*Annyeonghaseyo!* In late February, the first major COVID-19 outbreak to occur outside of China took place in our city of Daegu. It was here that South Koreas superspreader [caused an outbreak of over three thousand people in a matter of days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/how-one-patient-turned-korea-s-virus-outbreak-into-an-epidemic). The outbreak has been a tremendous challenge for our city, but it seems that the worst of it is behind us: over the past two-week period, Daegu has shown an average of just 2 new cases per day. 

We are two MDs whove been deeply involved in coordinating the pandemic response locally: Dr. Min on the medical/public health side, and Dr. Chung on the psychiatric counseling side. We are pleased to answer your questions today about our experience here in Korea or about our thoughts for you your city, or your nation. This is a global virus requiring global cooperation. Its our honor to share our knowledge and thoughts with your community today. AMA!

* Im Dr. Pok-kee Min, head of the Daegu COVID-19 response team. Im normally a dermatologist, but Ive been volunteering to oversee the citywide response, including shaping the public health strategy, deploying medical personnel, and coordinating government support. Ive tackled problems from how to dramatically increase hospital bed space citywide, to how to accelerate testing, to how to set up a quarantine. I was directly involved in getting the nations first drive-thru testing site up and running. An account of my experience was recently [featured in Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/a-south-korean-covid-19-czar-has-some-advice-for-trump/). Ill be answering any questions related to medical practices and public health policy. 

* And Im [Dr. Unsun Chung](https://www.avahealth.org/who_we_are/board_of_directors/board.html/title/unsun-chung-md-phd), the lead psychiatrist for South Koreas designated COVID-19 hospitals. As an associate professor of psychiatry at Kyungpook National University, my specialization is in catastrophe-related trauma. Throughout the outbreak, Ive been counseling COVID-19 patients suffering from emotional and psychological trauma, an effort funded by the federal Ministry of Health. As a board member of the Korean Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, Ive recently co-authored a manuscript called Guidelines on Psychosocial Care for Infectious Disease Management,  which we will soon make available in English. Im happy to answer any questions related to mental health and trauma: best practices for dealing with long-term isolation, how to talk to infected patients, or how weve helped patients, families, and medical staff cope with trauma and anxiety.

To make this AMA possible, a team of bilingual students will be assisting us with language translation: Sean Tae, Yunha Cho, Chaerin Yim, and Jihye Kim.

From u/davidkpham

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;tldr: [https://farmsthataredelivering.com](https://farmsthataredelivering.com/)  
&gt;  
&gt;My  friend Jason and I live in New York City and though I do love my  disaster go-to's Chef Boyardee and instant ramen, a few weeks ago I  started looking for meat and produce for my family so we could eat  healthier meals since it was already looking like we'd be in it for the  long haul. My mom's 70 and potentially immuno-compromised and my dad's  64 so going out wasn't a risk I wanted to take, so my only option was to  look online.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, my go-to's  like Instacart and Amazon Prime Now had no delivery times available and a  lot of meat/produce subscription box services had just started  waitlisting. Luckily, my friend Jason had been doing research and found a  few farms that shipped to us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Coincindentally, a while back I had read this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/fjj13f/gangwon_province_began_a_campaign_selling/)  about a South Korea province that helped farmers sell their produce  online and that combined with our personal experiences made me realize  that a database of farms that are currently in-stock and delivering  straight to people's doors would be a win-win - it would help farmers  and help people who want to cook at home like Jason and I safely get  meat and produce. So my friend Jason and I built it!  
&gt;  
&gt;We  currently have 32 farms that ship meat nationwide with 1 farm that  ships produce (more coming soon!). If you have any suggestions, whether  it's farms to add or ideas, please PM me!  
&gt;

You may have heard of recently announced contact tracing efforts, including a joint [proposal](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/apple-and-google-announced-a-coronavirus-tracking-system-how-worried-should-we-be/) by Apple and Google, that would use Bluetooth technology to help alert people who have been in close proximity to someone testing positive for COVID-19.
 
We just released a new [white paper](https://www.aclu.org/report/aclu-white-paper-principles-technology-assisted-contact-tracing) outlining a set of technology principles against which developers, policymakers, and the public can judge any contract tracing apps and protocols.
 
Questions? We'll be here at 3pm ET with answers.
 
Im Daniel Kahn Gillmor, u/dkg0, a staff technologist at the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. I work at the intersection of civil rights, civil liberties, and information technology. I work with lawyers and activists to help them make technically-relevant and feasible arguments and proposals for positive social change. And I work with engineers and designers to help them make technical decisions that protect civil rights and civil liberties by design. I'm a free software developer, a contributor to the Debian operating system, and a participant in standards bodies like the IETF. I have been active in discussions around tech-assisted contact tracing to help mitigate COVID-19, including the PACT group at MIT and the European initiative DP^3T. [Proof](https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1251138844591665153)
 
And Im Jon Callas, u/joncallas, a senior technology fellow with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. I work on issues surrounding encryption, forensics, machine learning, and surveillance with the lawyers and activists here. I also work on security and privacy standards to make sure they support civil liberties. In my past I was a co-founder of PGP, Silent Circle, and Blackphone. I've also worked at Apple on security audits and encryption. Apropos of this AMA, I have been working with groups doing proximity-based contact tracing to fight COVID-19 and was a contributor to the MIT PACT spec.

Hi, I'm Dr. Nuria Oliver, and I was recently appointed Commissioner for AI and COVID-19 at the Valencian Government. I am also Chief Data Scientist at Data-Pop Alliance, Chief Scientific Advisor to the Vodafone Institute and co-founder of ELLIS ([https://ellis.eu](https://ellis.eu/)).

By training, I am a Telecommunications Engineer from the Polytechnic University of Madrid and have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I firmly believe in the value of technology to improve the quality of life of people, both individually and collectively

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been working on using Data Science to help the Government of the Valencian region in Spain make better decisions based on evidence ([https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/ai-decoded/politico-ai-decoded-how-ai-is-helping-fight-a-pandemic-europes-coronavirus-app-insights-from-valencia/](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/ai-decoded/politico-ai-decoded-how-ai-is-helping-fight-a-pandemic-europes-coronavirus-app-insights-from-valencia/)). We have created a Data Science taskforce --composed of \~25 data scientists, a member of the Valencian Region President's office and the Data Protection Officer, working together on three large topics: (1) human mobility analysis and visualization; (2) epidemiological models; and (3) additional models. 

One of the projects that we have recently launched is the covid19impactsurvey to collect citizens data about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can help us out by filling out the survey here (https://covid19impactsurvey.org). It's become one of the world's largest citizen surveys with over 180,000 answers. It's an inspiring example of collaboration between citizens, experts and the public sector. We have published early results of the analysis here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01014](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01014)

I'm here to answer questions about how AI and Data Science are helping fight COVID-19, about creating data science teams within governments, about the use of Big Data for Social Good, about what we are thinking of doing now that we are entering the control phase of the pandemic...or anything else about Data Science to model human behavior

Dr. Raja and He are back again on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, weve treated a lot of COVID patients, seen this quickly evolve, and helped launch [GetUsPPE.org](https://getusppe.org)

Were back for updates, new questions, and discussion as the Pandemic evolves.
Lets talk about the following:

* What are we seeing in the ER (mindful of HIPPA)?
* What are the new interesting science weve seen?
* How can I be helpful to myself and my loved ones on the frontlines?


Note: We may collect data from the questions in this AMA to ways to better serve the public through both research and outreach. Advice is not to establish a patient/doctor relationship, but to guide public health.

Were working around the clock to make sure patients have the best care and that our staff is properly equipped to handle the surge of COVID-19 patients to our hospitals. My job is to set us up for success in managing the response at our hospitals, including educating the public and our staff on best practices and keeping the team up-to-date on the latest that we know about this novel strain of coronavirus. We all have a part to play in beating this disease, and Im drawing upon my training and experience in infectious diseases to lead the charge. By taking the right precautions and knowing the latest information about COVID-19, we can get through thistogether. Ask me anything. 

Proof: https://i.redd.it/2md3gzt2q2s41.jpg

EDIT: Thank you all for the thoughtful questions. I have to get back to being an infectious disease specialist and providing patient care but will try to pop in and answer as many more questions as possible in the next couple of days.

 Hi, I'm extremely curious about the recent claims about the drug hydroxychloroquine being used to treat patients with Covid-19. I am trying my best to stay medically literate through all this but there seems to be no real answer, studies out of Wuhan (not finished peer review) gave a group of 31 out of 62 with a mean age of 47 a dose of 500mg for 5 days, they report that the treatment helped slightly by bringing their fever down but nothing crazy. A doctor out of Los Angeles &amp; ceo of Mend urgent care claims that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and zinc supplements leave their patients completely symptom free in 8 - 12 hours (Absolutely no evidence whatsoever but people are raving at this regardless). Only armed with my grade 10 bio and after watching their explanations, it seems like they use the hydroxychloroquine to allow the lipid bilayer to be permeable to zinc? Not to sure but everything seems a bit off with this situation and I am really not sure what to think so I would extremely appreciate any input at all .

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at some more papers it seems true that the hydroxychloroquine reduces the binding of the (and I quote because I don't know if its relevant)  "antiphospholipid antibody-beta2-glycoprotein I complexes to phospholipid bilayers." Again not sure if its relevant just putting it out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there. We are journalists from [The Mercury News](http://mercurynews.com/) in San Jose, CA and [East Bay Times](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/) in Walnut Creek, CA covering Californias coronavirus crisis. 

We're here to talk to you about the state of the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area, how social distancing and a shelter-in-place order have changed how we are reporting stories, the Bay Areas and California's response to the crisis and anything else related to COVID-19 news. Ask Us Anything!

Weve been reporting on the pandemic for months, even before it reached our region. California recorded its first case Jan. 25 in Orange County. On Jan. 31, Santa Clara County, the most populous county in the Bay Area and where San Jose is located, recorded its first COVID-19 case. Since then, our newsroom has taken an all-hands-on-deck approach to reporting on the pandemic. 

Its been a rollercoaster few months. Here are just a few developments that have happened here. 

* The [coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-grand-princess-to-dock-in-oakland-at-noon/) docked in Oakland, CA after days of idling at sea
* Officials issued a [shelter-in-place order](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/29/she-shut-down-the-bay-area-to-slow-the-deadly-coronavirus-none-of-us-really-believed-we-would-do-it/) in the Bay Area before the state of California issued one. Then they extended it and [made it stricter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/01/coronavirus-qa-how-the-bay-areas-extended-stay-at-home-order-changes-the-rules/). 
* We continue to learn more about the [statewide testing backlog](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-california-cases-top-15000-testing-backlog-begins-to-clear/). And more about [testing in general](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-new-stanford-research-reveals-if-youve-been-exposed/).
* And economic gloom: Gov. Gavin Newsom says [more than 2.3 million people](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-economic-economy-fallout-trend-3-million-jobless-california-tech-hotel-restaurant-retail-newsom/) in California have filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.

About us:

**Lisa Krieger:** I cover science and medicine for The Mercury News. Ive been following the coronavirus closely and have focused my reporting on testing and tracing the virus. I joined the Mercury News in 1998. 

**Maggie Angst:** I've covered San Jose city government for The Mercury News for the past year but within the last month have transitioned over to almost solely covering the coronavirus -- from local San Jose measures like a new paid sick leave policy, to a residential eviction moratoriums to statewide efforts to increase testing and flattening the curve.

**Jose Carlos Fajardo:** Im a Senior Staff Photographer for Bay Area News Group and have worked here for 26 years. I recently finished a [series of portraits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/07/how-9-bay-area-families-are-coping-at-home-in-the-covid-19-age/) of people and their families taking shelter in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A note from the a member of the team u/climbing_prof:

I'm Professor [Grace O'Connell](https://oconnell.berkeley.edu/people/grace-d-oconnell-phd/) from UC Berkeley and working with a large team of engineers and physicians to [repurpose sleep apnea machines](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2020/04/turning-sleep-apnea-machines-into-ventilators/) for COVID19 patients. The device filters delivered and exhaled air to reduce the risk of contamination to medical professionals and the surrounding environment (a concern brought up with using sleep apnea machines in their current form).

[VentilatorSOS.com](http://ventilatorsos.com/) has intake forms for people that are willing to donate their sleep apnea machine. These deviceshave relatively low compliance rates, so we believe there are potentially millions of devices sitting in people's closets. After our story was shown on the[ local news ](https://abc7news.com/health/exclusive-bay-area-group-says-donating-your-cpap-or-bipap-device-could-help-save-lives/6072836/)we received over 360 registrations for donations.

**We need sleep apnea machine donations for this tobe successful - please share this information with anyone that you know thatmight have such amachine hanging around.**
